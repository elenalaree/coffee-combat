A java script code quizzing game.

I chose to make the game the way I did based on what I learned in the modules. I created it in javascript almost exclusively. I wanted it to have a clean flow so I made it by creating functions that held cards to show each 'page' of my quiz.

I struggled with saving to local memory.
