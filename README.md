# coffee-combat
A java script code quizzing game.

I chose to make the game the way I did based on what I learned in the modules. I created it in javascript almost exclusively. I wanted it to have a clean flow so I made it by creating functions that held cards to show each 'page' of my quiz.

The quiz timer starts after pressing 'Start Combat, ticking down one second at a time. Each right answer rewards the user with ten seconds of time. Each wrong answer subtracts ten seconds of time. Upon completing the quiz, the user receives their score. If they didn't finish before time out, they receive a score of 0. Clicking clear scores removes all scores from local memory.
